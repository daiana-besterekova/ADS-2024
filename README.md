# Global Terrorism Database

## Description 

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a publicly accessible database that contains comprehensive information on terrorist attacks worldwide spanning from 1970 to 2017 and provides systematic data on over 180,000 attacks. 


## Data Collection 

Data was collected by National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.

## Variables

There are 42 variables on location, tactics, perpetrators, targets, and outcomes

## Potential questions 

1. Are there temporal patterns in terrorist activities, and can time series analysis help uncover recurring trends or seasonal variations?
2. How does the frequency and severity of terrorist attacks vary across different regions, and can statistical analysis identify significant differences?
3. What are the common characteristics of terrorist incidents, and can machine learning algorithms be applied to identify potential risk factors or predictive patterns?
4. Are there correlations between socio-economic indicators and the occurrence of terrorism, and can data integration with external datasets enhance the analysis?

## Methods and Libraries: 
**1. Data Visualization:**
- Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Method: Create visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to represent trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

**2. Descriptive Statistics:**
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
- Method: Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the basic characteristics of the dataset.

**3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
- Library: Pandas
- Method: Use Pandas for data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset into a suitable format for analysis.

**4. Machine Learning (Classification):**
- Library: Scikit-learn
- Method: Apply machine learning algorithms for classification to predict and identify patterns associated with specific types of terrorist incidents.

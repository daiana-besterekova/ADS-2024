# SUPPORT2 Dataset on critically ill 

## Description 

Utilizing the dataset comprising 9105 critically ill patients from five medical centers across the United States, I embarked on a journey to develop a predictive model for patients' 2- and 6-month survival rates, and much more. This dataset, spanning the years 1989-1991 and 1992-1994, offered a wealth of information on physiological parameters, demographics, and disease severity indicators.

## Data Collection 

Data was collected by Professor Frank Harrell at Vanderbilt University Department of Biostatistics

## Variables

There are 48 variables on physiological parameters, demographics, and disease severity indicators

## Methods and Libraries: 
**1. Data Visualization:**
- Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Method: Create visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to represent trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

**2. Descriptive Statistics:**
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
- Method: Calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the basic characteristics of the dataset.

**3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
- Library: Pandas
- Method: Use Pandas for data cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming the dataset into a suitable format for analysis.

**4. Machine Learning (Classification):**
- Library: Scikit-learn
- Method: Apply machine learning algorithms for classification to predict and identify patterns associated with specific types of terrorist incidents.
